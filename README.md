# Remnants


 Why pay corporate for it if you can just find it out in the wild? 
 Let out your inner scavenger and find the tools that were left behind by former, less fortunate employees.
 
This mod spreads items from the store around on the moons for you to find along with your usual scrap. 
Battery levels may vary. For full battery levels, consult the Lethal Company store.

Adds store items as scrap, to be found on moons as scrap in Lethal Company.
Along this, there is a small chance that you will find a corpse along the scrap you find.

## Mechanics:

#### Register store items as scrap, also known as remnant items.
This mod takes the game's store items and registers them as scrap, so you can find these store items on moons alongside other scrap.
Remnant items that use a battery will have a random battery charge to make it seem as if they have been used.
This mod is also compatible with other mods that add more items to the game, which means that you can find modded store items on moons as well.

#### Spawn bodies near remnant items.
Now there is a chance that a body will spawn near a remnant item. There are four different types of bodies (default body, cocooned body, spring body, and head burst body). Each of these body types have unique enemies ascribed to them to determine which body is spawned in. As such, depending on the moon and the enemies that spawn there, a different body will spawn. Based on the enemy's spawn rate, their linked body types will also spawn more or less. For example: on your current moon, there is a high chance for a spider to spawn, so, when a body spawns, it is far more likely to be a cocooned body.
The bodies used were part of the original version of Lethal Company, but they are loaded in via an asset bundle for easier access to the bodies.

#### Config.
Here's what you can edit and change via the config.
Remnant items:
- The minimum and maximum spawn chance (rarity) on all moons.
- The individual minimum and maximum spawn chance (rarity) for vanilla moons.
- The individual minimum and maximum spawn chance (rarity) for modded moons.
- You can choose if you want a general rarity for all moons or a unique value for each moon.
- The battery charge of remnant items with a minimum and maximum charge.
- A list of banned items, preventing these items from being registered as scrap and becoming remnant items.
- Choosing spawn options per item, using credit cost, choosing your own spawn rarity or disabling spawning entirely.
- Makes you able to edit the minimum and maximum scrap cost of remnant items via the config.
- A list of scrap items that you can add in acting as remnant items for body spawning and randomizing batteries.

Spawning remnant items:
- The minimum and maximum remnant items spawned on moons.
- A modifier that increases the amount of remnant items that spawns on moons, depending on the risk level of that moon.
- The maximum duplicates of the same remnant item that can spawn on a moon.
- The maximum remnant items found on a body.

Spawning remnant items: (legacy spawning)
- Use legacy spawning, spawning like normal scrap. This will prevent the other way of spawning remnant items.
- Increasing the maximum spawning pool of scrap so there will be enough normal scrap to find.

Body spawning:
- To make them grabbbable with a scrap value or have them just as a prop and non interactable.
- The scrap value of a body.
- The spawn chance of bodies.
- The body spawn modifier in relation to the moon risk level.
- Banning suits from being put on bodies.

Save/Load:
- Save remnant items.
- Despawn remnant items on party wipe.
- Despawn all remnant items regardless where they are when leaving a moon.
