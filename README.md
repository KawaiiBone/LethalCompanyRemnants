# Remnants


 Why pay corporate for it if you can just find it out in the wild? 
 Let out your inner scavenger and find the tools that were left behind by former, less fortunate employees.
 
This mod spreads items from the store around on the moons for you to find along with your usual scrap. 
Battery levels may vary. For full battery levels, consult the Lethal Company store.

Adds store items as scrap, to be found on moons as scrap in Lethal Company.


## Feedback and issues
If you find any bugs, issues, or have any feedback on how to improve the mod, you are always welcome to share it here on [Github](https://github.com/KawaiiBone/LethalCompanyRemnants/issues) or on the [Unofficial Lethal Company discord](https://discord.com/invite/nYcQFEpXfU). When you report an issue, please be sure to add the error in question and what other mods you were using at the time of the error. This way I can easily find the bug and patch it.

## Future Work: 
I intend to focus on the config, so that you can edit the settings for the scrap items.
The plan was to add bodies of past employees to the scrap list, but due to a whole load of technical issues, I've had to temporarily abandon that idea. 
You can expect regular updates for bug fixes as well.

## Added a part of the config
Now the config has been added and the appdata save file has become obsolete.
The config can be found and edited in your BepInEx congif folder or in your mod manager, but first you need to start up your game to let it make the config file. For now it can change, general rarity, battery of remnant items and a banning list of items to not be registered as scrap. There is already a list of all the remnant items in the config loaded when you join a lobby, but it does not work yet. (It does not save correctly)
