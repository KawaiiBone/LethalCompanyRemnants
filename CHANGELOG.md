- Release

#1.1.0
- Increased the chance of store scrap items appearing from 1%-10% to 5%-25%.
- Fixed the battery scrap bug. This bug caused only the host to receive partially charged items, and whenever the host would buy an item from the store, the item wouldn't be fully charged.
     Now only the scrap items you find around the map have a random battery charge, which is consistent for all players currently present in the game.
- Fixed a bug where if multiple mods tried to register the same item as scrap, the game returned error prompts.

#1.1.1
- Added a new feature where you can determine which scrap items spawn and which don’t by editing a Json file. Explenation is in the README.
- Fixed a bug where the mod would only register mod items as scrap, instead of both mod and vanilla items
